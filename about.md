My name's Noah Manger and I care about justice, democracy, design and technology, and that's most of what I'll be writing about here.

I've worked as an electoral organizer and vote-driver, an event planner and a conference-creator. I was previously working as a designer, product manager and front-end developer at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov), and now I'm a product manager at [Zapier](https://zapier.com). Views here are strictly my own. 

I grew up in Michigan, and now live in Portland, Oregon. Find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/noahmanger) and [GitHub](https://github.com/noahmanger) or [send me an email](mailto:noah.manger@gmail.com) if you want.
