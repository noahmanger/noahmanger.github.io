I'm fascinated by modern-day patriotism, full of paradoxes and inconsistencies. Coming of age as I did during the Bush years, my first full-formed thoughts about patriotism were concerend with what it was then: a gross, militaristic vulgarity. It reached such levels of absurdity that *Team America* and the *Colbert Report* basically *had* to happen. As my generation grew up, we followed in the tradition, taking the traditional symbols of patriotism, chopping them up and turning them into ironic flag tanktops, eagle gifs and ["America, Fucky Yeah" enthusiasm](https://www.tumblr.com/search/america+fuck+yeah). 

The American left loves to point to the robust social states of northern Europe, but now we're watching those societies bend under the the weight of their newfound cultural diversity.

It's a history full of continuing to examine the question of who actually has the right to determine "what ought to be".

But as we continue to try to "seize what ought to be" we have some crucial decisions to confront. Will we continue to build a system of self-government that embraces the diversity of voices in America or will we put up barriers to participation? 

The arc of history only bends towards justice because we as a people bend that way while others try to bend it another. 

Just look at the way the [battle over voting rights](https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/voting-laws-roundup-2015) has played out all over the country the last several years, as states wrestle with a question as old as the country: who actually has the right to determine what ought to be?
